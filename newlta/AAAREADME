Scripts for interfacing the disk dumper to the new LTA code.
General idea:
Run a script on submit-1 or a cobalt to poll the REST server
to learn of new directories available for verification and
bundling.
For each, create a condor job and submit this to checksum and
bundle.
HOW DO WE LIMIT THE NUMBER OF JOBS?
HOW DO WE MONITOR THE JOBS? -- Success/Failure/Retry?

The only robust way to monitor for success is to actually look
at the log files.

Therefore I need, in the database that governs this, at least
3 different status possibilities for a new directory:
0   = To Be Handed Off to LTA
1   = LTA Attempting to Ingest This
2   = LTA Ingest Succeeded

If there are more steps involved, I'll need more options.  But
I hope I can just hand it off and let LTA monitor itself.
