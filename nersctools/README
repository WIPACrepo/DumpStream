Using python3, using a virtual environment 
(e.g. ~jbellinger/archivemonitor/venv)

I want to maintain consistency between chunks of code, so the utility
code is in the import files
IMPORT_db.py	For mysql accesses
IMPORT_utils.py For everything else
and the codebase that I want to keep the same everywhere is in
CODE_db.py	For mysql access
CODE_utils.py	For everything else

The preprocessor is
preproc.py
e.g.
python preproc.py BundleScanner.py.base
 creates BundleScanner.py

The advantage to using this rather than a local environment is
ease of setup: I only need a single python file at NERSC.

The stripped-down code is in the py.base files

NERSC_Client.py.base
   This is the NERSC command center.  It checks our rest server
    to see what needs doing next, doles out slurm jobs to move
    new bundles into HPSS, cleans out old scratch area bundles
    when they are safely in HPSS, and tells the rest server
    when all is done.  It can run on any cori system, or several
    (only one gets to run) in case one cori system goes off the
    air.
