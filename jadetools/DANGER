I need to keep track of which _bundles_ were shipped with a given directory,
since later bundles may be added.  I have to notify LTA about them.  My own
transfer stuff should be OK.

If the bundle is skipped in globus, the json is moved to mirror_cache, not
to problem_files
BundleStatus thus thinks it is OK
The only saving grace here is that the file never shows up at NERSC, so
the NERSC system doesn't process an empty file and never resets the status.
