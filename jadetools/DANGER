Potential race condition.
If the Pole tape dumper is writing the last file to a directory, and the Jade-LTA
feeder notices that the directory APPEARS TO BE complete, the bundler may begin
work on the contents before it is ready.  It _should_ fail because of the incomplete
file's checksum, but that's another failure condition to monitor.

Since I haven't written the Jade-LTA feeder yet, this is something to keep an eye on.
I'm not sure I have the size information, though.
