This is the tree for the to-NERSC lta chain.  The
chain consists of 4 main parts:
archivecontrol rest server:	(which uses apachetest.conf and rest.py)
jade-lta server:		(BundleScanner.py)
nersc server:			(NERSC_Client.py)
dumpercontrol			(DumpControl.py)

jadetools	contains BundleScanner.py and various utility
   programs we run in Madison
nersctools	contains NERSC_Client.py and runs at NERSC
dumper		contains python and bash scripts for reading
   Pole disks

In addition we have in this directory, though not in git (for
obvious reasons) a rotating backup of the sqlite3 database
on archivecontrol.

archivecontrol runs its rest server from /opt/testing/rest

archivecontrol uses apache, and in /etc/httpd/conf.d has my
apachetest.conf to point queries to the right code

archivecontrol uses the Flask utility to handle the interface
between sqlite3 and python.  The tool rest.py manages the
processing, and rest.wsgi tells apache where to look for the
rest.py file  config.py tells Flask what the initial settings
are.


The disk dumping is handled differently.

To load fresh info about what is on the new disks:
ssh i3admin@jade03 /opt/i3admin/dumpscripts/newset
This overwrites anything that was already done, btw

Want to see the status of the disks?
ssh i3admin@jade03 cat /opt/i3admin/dumpscripts/INHAND

To dump the next disk in line:
ssh i3admin@jade03 /opt/i3admin/dumpscripts/rundumpone
That submits a job to dump the next disk.  If any.  No errors are returned,
though some are logged

I should try to put all the command info into a single place,
presumably the same one I use for to-NERSC

I did something quite crazy and non-pythonic to keep the footprint
small:  I use a preprocessor instead of a python library.  This
achieves the same result--keeping utility code in one place and
consistent for all tools (except the rest.py wsgi handler)--but
means I only have one script, as a rule, to schlepp around.
In retrospect, that was crazy, but I was in an experimental mood,
and it doesn't hurt readability/maintainability.
